First, click the MetaMask extension icon (the fox) in your browser
In the MetaMask popup:
Look at the top where it shows the network
Click the dropdown
Select "Sepolia" from the list
The MetaMask extension (fox icon) and the MetaMask website/portfolio might show different networks, but what matters is what's selected in the extension popup.

If you don't see Sepolia in the dropdown list:

Click "Add network"
Click "Add a network manually"
Enter these details:
Network Name: Sepolia

Block Explorer URL: https://sepolia.etherscan.io
